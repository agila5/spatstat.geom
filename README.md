# spatstat.geom

This is a subset of the original `spatstat` package.

The original `spatstat` package is still available
at its [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat)
or at [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat).

The original `spatstat` package is currently being split into
several sub-packages.

This package `spatstat.geom` is one of the
sub-packages. It contains the
definitions of spatial objects (point patterns, windows, pixel images, etc)
and the functionality for geometrical operations (intersection, union,
shift, rotate, measure areas, nearest neighbour distance,
pairwise distances, distance transform, plotting, etc).

The reorganisation of the `spatstat` family is described
on the GitHub repository
[baddstats/spatstat](https://github.com/baddstats/spatstat).
