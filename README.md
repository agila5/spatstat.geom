# spatstat.geom

The original `spatstat` package has been split into
several sub-packages.

This package `spatstat.geom` is one of the
sub-packages. It contains the
definitions of spatial objects (point patterns, windows, pixel images, etc)
and the functionality for geometrical operations (intersection, union,
shift, rotate, measure areas, nearest neighbour distance,
pairwise distances, distance transform, plotting, etc).

The reorganisation of `spatstat` into a family of packages is described
on the GitHub repository
[spatstat/spatstat](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat).
