# spatstat.geom

## Spatial data classes and geometrical functionality for the spatstat family

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/spatstat.geom)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat.geom) 
[![GitHub R package version](https://img.shields.io/github/r-package/v/spatstat/spatstat.geom)](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat.geom)

The original `spatstat` package has been split into
several sub-packages.

This package `spatstat.geom` is one of the sub-packages. It contains functions for

- definitions of spatial objects (point patterns, windows, pixel images, line segment patterns, tessellations, 3D point patterns, general multidimensional space-time point patterns, linear networks)

- interactive data entry and editing for spatial objects

- printing and plotting spatial objects (including colour images, contour plots, perspective views, composite images)

- conversion of types (pixellation, discretisation, interpolation, solution set, level set)

- basic summary information about spatial objects

- subsetting, splitting, superimposing spatial patterns

- extracting information such as spatial coordinates

- identifying duplicated elements

- geometrical transformations such as rotating, rescaling, shifting, reflecting, applying affine transformations

- geometrical operations such as intersection, union, complement, set difference, convex hull, point-in-set

- geometrical mensuration (measuring areas, lengths, angles, diameter)

- distance operations: nearest neighbour, nearest neighbour distance, pairwise distances, distance map, distance transform

- geometrical constructions (tessellations, triangulation, discretisation, bounding box)

- mathematical morphology (erosion, dilation, opening, closing, morphological distance transform)

- pixel-by-pixel arithmetic

- set covariance function, convolution of images

- graphical information (layered objects, colour maps, symbol maps)

- quadrat counting

The reorganisation of `spatstat` into a family of packages is described
on the GitHub repository
[spatstat/spatstat](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat).

This repository holds the latest development version of `spatstat.geom`.
